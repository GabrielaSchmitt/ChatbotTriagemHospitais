This repository contains the project "Chatbot for Pre-Triage in Hospitals," presented at the 1st Extension Show at Universidade Positivo. The project was developed as part of the course "Industry 4.0 Challenges for Innovation at Hospital Pequeno Príncipe," in collaboration with Beatriz Marques.

The chatbot aims to optimize the pre-triage process at Hospital Pequeno Príncipe, reducing congestion and enhancing efficiency by automating the initial patient interaction process. It offers patients a virtual assistant for pre-triage through WhatsApp, a widely accessible platform.
